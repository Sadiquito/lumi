# Lumi – App Flow, Pages & Roles

## User Roles
- **Single Role**: Authenticated user via Google login
- No admin interface, settings panel, or monetization tiers in prototype phase

## Page List and Descriptions

### 1. Landing Page
- **Purpose**: Introduce Lumi and invite users to begin their first conversation
- **Elements**:
  - Hero section with app name, logo, and primary CTA: “Begin Your Conversation”
  - Brief description of Lumi as a voice-first introspection companion
  - Soothing artwork that matches the "cosmic sunset" aesthetic
- **Flow**: CTA → Google OAuth Login → Redirect to Journaling Page

### 2. Journaling Page (Post-login Default)
- **Purpose**: Central hub for both conversation launching and journal review
- **Elements**:
  - One large animated button: "Start Conversation"
    - Indicates Lumi's speaking/listening status via visual pulse
  - List of prior conversations sorted by timestamp
  - Transcript display styled by speaker (user vs Lumi)
  - Top of each entry includes Lumi's short reflections or follow-up questions
  - Empty state if no conversations yet: clear invitation to start
- **Flow**: Redirect from login or post-session, navigable from anywhere in-app

### 3. Conversation Experience (Triggered from Journaling Page)
- **Purpose**: Facilitate hands-free, voice-only interaction with Lumi
- **Flow Behavior**:
  - Conversation begins with Lumi initiating: 
    - “Do you want to tell me what’s on your mind today, or would you like me to propose a topic?”
  - User responds via browser microphone capture
  - VAD detects end-of-user speech and triggers GPT-4o + memory
  - Lumi's reply is voiced via ElevenLabs TTS and transcribed
  - User may interrupt Lumi at any time by speaking again
  - The session ends when user says so, or Lumi infers natural close
- **Displayed Elements**:
  - Live, scrollable transcript (user and Lumi clearly differentiated)
  - Optional subtle playback controls for user (pause/resume)
  - Visual cue showing active listening/speaking states

Lumi's flow prioritizes simplicity and immediacy: one entry point, one main interaction mode, one central relationship. Every screen should reinforce this rhythm and remove anything that distracts from the voice-based journaling experience.
